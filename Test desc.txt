Test 1
Accuracy vs Output frame (10-40)

Test 2
Accuracy vs split of training testing (Random split and split by person)

Test 3
changed the data size from 40 frames to 80 frames.
- zero appended
- zero prepended
- first frame prepended
- last frame appended

Test 4
Number of frames changes as x+40-1 (x in range 0 to 20)
prepending first frame

Test 5 (same as Test 4)
prepending zero frame 

Test 6 (2x)
gesture computation at two checkpoints
"is classification dependent on what is classified before? for each
test sample, prepend another randomly chosen test sample and let the net
run on the extended sample of 2X frames. Evaluating at the end of sample
1 (frameX) and again at the end of sample 2 (frame 2X). Is
classification on sample 2 as good as the classification on normal test
set?"

Test 7 
total numbers of frames = 60 (fixed)
initialised as zero frames
video sample inserted at n index (n in range 0-20) 
split train test 
train
test

Test 8
total numbers of frames = 60 (fixed)
choosing a random number between 0-390 (total number of video samples)
chosing the video sample at that index (chosing the random video sample)
initialise the 60 frames as 40 frames +half of the 40 frames of the sample (40+20)
video sample inserted at n index (n in range 0-20) 
split train test 
train
test

Test 9
total numbers of frames = 60 (fixed)
choosing a random number between 0-390 (total number of video samples)
chosing the video sample at that index (chosing the random video sample)
initialise the 60 frames as 40 frames +half of the 40 frames of the sample (40+20)
N (in the range of 0-20)
video sample inserted at a random x index (x in range 0-N) 
split train test

Test 10
Same as test 9 but for yero frames
