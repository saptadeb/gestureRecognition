new tasks:
  - augment data
  - from every sample generate several new samples and add them to the data (split train/test afterwards)
  - define an N, every sample will have K+N frames
  - for i = 1 to N; do "prepend i zero-frames; fill remaining frames at the end with  0 ; add new sample to database" ; done
  - split train/.test
  - train/test

- Have a look at sensor: see if there are ROS drivers for it.. the interface is called "DepthSense"
